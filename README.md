# CRUD With Hibernate Framework

## Objective
The objective of this practical work is to gain skills in using the Hibernate ORM framework for working with relational databases.

## Overview
This practical work focuses on utilizing the Hibernate ORM framework to develop a database processing application. Hibernate serves as a bridge between Java objects and relational database tables, providing a convenient way to perform CRUD operations and manage entity relationships.

### Service Layer
In this context, the service layer acts as an intermediary between the presentation layer (UI/Controllers) and the data access layer (Repositories). It encapsulates business logic and orchestrates interactions between different parts of the system.

### Benefits of Hibernate
1. **ORM Functionality**: Hibernate simplifies database interactions by mapping Java objects to database tables, relieving developers from writing tedious SQL queries.
2. **Transaction Management**: Hibernate provides built-in support for managing database transactions, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
3. **Entity Relationship Management**: With Hibernate, defining and managing entity relationships such as One-to-Many and Many-to-Many becomes straightforward through annotations.
4. **Automatic Schema Generation**: Hibernate can automatically generate database schema based on entity mappings, reducing the need for manual schema creation.
5. **Flexibility**: Hibernate supports various database vendors and configurations, offering flexibility in application development.

By leveraging Hibernate, developers can build robust and scalable database applications with ease, focusing more on application logic rather than low-level database interactions.

## Tasks
1. **Create Maven Project**: Create an empty Maven project template for further work with Hibernate.

2. **Create Empty Database**: Prepare an empty database to be used by the application.

3. **Hibernate Integration**: Integrate Hibernate into your project and configure it to interact with the database.

4. **Write Code in Hibernate JPA**: Write code using Hibernate JPA (Java Persistence API) instead of Hibernate Native API.

5. **Configuration with hibernate.properties**: Configure Hibernate using the hibernate.properties file.

6. **Generate Database Schema**: Set a property to instruct Hibernate to generate the database schema automatically.

7. **CamelCase to snake_case Conversion**: Set a property to convert CamelCase to snake_case for class fields and table attributes.

8. **Create Entity Classes**: Create at least 4 entity classes with JPA annotations.

9. **Establish Entity Relationships**: Establish One-to-Many and Many-to-Many relationships between entities.

10. **Generate Fake Data**: After generating the schema, generate fake data for all tables using libraries like JavaFaker.

11. **Take Database Screenshot**: Capture a screenshot of the database generated by Hibernate.

12. **CRUD Operations**: Write several CRUD functions in the Main class using Hibernate only.

## Usage
- Clone the repository.
- Set up and configure your database.
- Run the application to execute CRUD operations and observe the Hibernate-generated database schema.
